# Airbnb Data Analysis (PYTHON)

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Airbnb listing data using Python to uncover meaningful insights related to pricing, availability, property types, and location-based trends. By applying data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization techniques, the project aims to support data-driven decision-making for hosts, customers, and business stakeholders.

## Problem Statements
The project focuses on answering the following key business and analytical questions:
- What factors influence Airbnb listing prices?
- How does availability vary across different neighborhoods and property types?
- Which room types and locations are most popular among customers?
- Are there noticeable trends or patterns in pricing and reviews?
- How can hosts optimize pricing and availability based on data insights?

## Data Visualization & Analysis
Various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used to visualize and analyze the dataset.

#### Key Visualizations Created:

### Price Distribution Analysis

- Histograms and box plots to understand pricing spread and detect outliers.

### Room Type Analysis

- Bar charts showing the count and average price of different room types.

### Neighborhood-Based Analysis

- To identify relationships between price, reviews, availability, and minimum nights.

Insights Gained:
- Entire homes/apartments are generally priced higher than private or shared rooms.
- Listings in prime locations have higher average prices.
- High availability does not always correlate with higher prices.
- A moderate correlation exists between price and minimum nights.

## Conclusions
- Location and room type are the most significant factors affecting Airbnb prices.
- Budget-friendly options are mostly private and shared rooms.
- Listings with competitive pricing tend to have higher availability.
- Outliers in pricing can significantly impact average price calculations, making data cleaning essential.

## Final Summary
This project demonstrates the effective use of Python for data analysis and visualization. By transforming raw Airbnb data into actionable insights, the analysis highlights how data-driven strategies can improve pricing decisions and customer satisfaction. The project also strengthens practical skills in data preprocessing, EDA, and visualization, making it highly relevant for real-world data analyst roles.
